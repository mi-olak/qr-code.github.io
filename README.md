## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid


### What I learned
 
i think this project is a good way to practice using float and how to structure the contents on your page properly. 


### Continued development

i have more work to do on flex but, nonetheless, I'm still very much excited to see other cool things i can do with it.


### Useful resources
